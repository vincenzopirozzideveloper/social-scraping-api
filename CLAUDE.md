# Project: Instagram Scraper with Playwright

## Overview
This project is an Instagram automation tool built with Playwright in Python. It provides a console-based interface for browser automation and Instagram interactions.

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Main application with console menu and browser automation
- `credentials.json` - Login credentials (gitignored)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.docs/` - Reference documentation folder with examples and patterns

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Language**: All code, comments, and console output must be in English
- **Structure**: Minimal, functional approach without boilerplate
- **Error Handling**: Use try/except blocks with clear error messages
- **Console Feedback**: Provide step-by-step feedback for user actions

## .docs Folder
The `.docs` folder contains reference materials and patterns for Playwright usage, particularly for:
- Network request interception
- GraphQL handling
- Authentication flows
- Best practices for Instagram automation

## Git Commit Guidelines
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive
- Focus on what changed, not implementation details
- No references to AI assistance or Claude
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Example: "Add login automation with cookie handling"

## Development Workflow
1. Always work on `development` branch
2. Test changes before committing
3. Keep commits atomic and focused
4. Maintain clean console output in English
