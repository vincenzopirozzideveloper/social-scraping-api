# ‚úÖ MCP Server Configuration Complete

## Configured MCP Servers

All MCP servers are now active and connected to Claude Code CLI:

### 1. **Filesystem Server** ‚úì Connected
- **Purpose**: Navigate and read your project files
- **Path**: `/home/coder/dev/scraper-3`
- **Benefits**: I can directly access your code for better context

### 2. **Playwright Server** ‚úì Connected  
- **Purpose**: Playwright API documentation and best practices
- **Benefits**: Correct selectors, wait strategies, API usage

### 3. **GitHub Server** ‚úì Connected
- **Purpose**: Access official Playwright repositories
- **Benefits**: Real-world examples from Microsoft's Playwright repos

### 4. **Sequential Thinking** ‚úì Connected
- **Purpose**: Complex logic and step-by-step reasoning
- **Benefits**: Better planning for multi-step automation tasks

### 5. **Memory Server** ‚úì Connected
- **Purpose**: Context retention across conversations
- **Benefits**: Remember patterns and preferences from earlier in session

## How These Help Your Instagram Scraper

### Better Request Interception
With Playwright MCP, I can suggest optimal patterns:
```python
# Professional response handling
async with page.expect_response(
    lambda r: "/graphql/query" in r.url and "data" in r.json()
) as response_info:
    await page.click("#submit")
```

### Robust Selectors
Instead of fragile CSS selectors:
```python
# MCP-guided approach
page.get_by_role("button", name="Like")
page.locator('[aria-label*="Comment"]')
```

### Error Handling
Proper timeout and retry logic:
```python
# With MCP knowledge
try:
    await page.wait_for_selector('.post', state='visible', timeout=5000)
except TimeoutError:
    # Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
```

## Commands to Manage MCP

```bash
# List all servers
claude mcp list

# Add a new server
claude mcp add <name> -- npx -y <package>

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove <name>

# Check server health
claude mcp list  # Shows connection status
```

## What You Can Ask Now

With MCP servers active, you can ask:

1. **"Show me the best way to handle Instagram's rate limiting"**
   - I'll use GitHub MCP to find real examples

2. **"What's in my ig_scraper/api folder?"**
   - Filesystem MCP lets me explore your project structure

3. **"How should I structure the login flow?"**
   - Sequential thinking + Playwright docs for optimal architecture

4. **"Remember this pattern for later"**
   - Memory MCP retains important patterns

## Verification

Run this to confirm all servers are connected:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

Expected output:
```
filesystem: ‚úì Connected
playwright-server: ‚úì Connected
github: ‚úì Connected
sequential-thinking: ‚úì Connected
memory: ‚úì Connected
```
